#Estimating rotavirus vaccine efficacy

#Description: This code accompanies the paper: Efficacy of live oral rotavirus
# vaccines by duration of follow-up: a meta-regression of 
# randomised controlled trials
# In order to accurately capture the effect of waning VE, we fit out models
# to cumulative incidence values extracted from multiple RCTs.
# Extracted data is provided in the csv file (see prepare ).
# We fit models with different assumptions about waning vaccine efficacy using
# Rjags. Models are compared visually, and by the DIC value (see)

#prepare extracted data pooled analysis
#We re-calculate the RR in exactly the same way in each study period.
#We need to calculate the relative risk, due to the sparse follow-up
# data, and because censored number of people is not consistently 
# available in each study.
#Will create a data-table with the cleaned and processed estimates: vaccine_efficacy_data
